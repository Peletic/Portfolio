## This 'portfolio'

Idk I used astro and stuff and i had to type some stuff and redo some stuff. I'm not 100% sure that this follows the assignment guidelines but what the heck. The dynamic markdown with the blog stuff isn't mine, i just modded it a little. Writing garbage like this seems awfully easy given that you aren't grading me on the quality of this text.
