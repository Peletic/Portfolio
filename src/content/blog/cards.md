Another school project had me writing down the class's vocabulary terms and putting them on a quizlet-esque card thingie. Instead of doing what it said, I made a template style component that let me set the title and description and the like. The way I did it was like

| Term                               | Front description                               | Back meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pass in a front title & back title | Find where the unit that should have used it is | Use `github copilot` to automatically fill in the definition for me. It felt cheaty and I understand the copilot is super unethical, but, not having to write all of the boilerplate just makes me feel better. |
