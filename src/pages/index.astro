			<h1>Hi there! üêà</h1>
			<p>
				I'm a high school student and through two years of dedicated practice, I've gained fluency in Java,
				Javascript, and Typescript. At the same time I've been getting to know C++, C#, Rust, Kotlin, Shell, and Bash.
				I've built websites with Vanilla HTML/JS, React.js, Next.js, Astro.js, and styling dependencies such
				as Bootstrap, Tailwind, Aceternity, DaisyUI, and Shadcn/ui.
			</p>
			<p>I enjoy</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Computer games</li>
				<li>Making cheater programs for single-player computer games</li>
				<li>Overengineering <code>(view ../pages/[...slug])</code></li>
				<li>Learning good coding practices</li>
				<li>Not using aforementioned good coding practices</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This is my (very good) portfolio website. This paragraph block should probably be a better introduction, however, I am purely stalling to take up whitespace on the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				This page was made with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> and a shocking lack of care.
